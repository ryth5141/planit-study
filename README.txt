README (UPDATE AS OF MONDAY, 29 APRIL 2019)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
PURPOSE:
PlanIt Study Assistant is an online planner for students at the high school and university levels. Since most school work is conducted online these days, we’re hoping to bring online planners to the same medium as course assignments and class pages. PlanIt is a central hub for students to track due dates, assignments reminders, assignment to-do lists, and their grades.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
REPOSITORY ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE:
When you first view the repository, you are introduced to several folders and other files. Our ‘views’ folder contains almost all our HTML pages within PlanIt, while the ‘img’ and ‘style’ contains most CSS and JavaScript styling folders. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are interested in viewing the group milestones, the ‘Milestones’ folder will contain .pdf copies of all those. We update appropriately whenever tasked with another milestone. 

Our back-end development was handled within the ‘node_modules’ and respective .json, .sql, and .js files within the page. While we would have wanted to clean this up more nicely, we ran into difficulties moving some of these folders around. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
MODIFICATION OF DOCUMENTATION:
All of our source code can be conveniently accessed and modified on GitHub.

If you’re hoping to make appropriate changes to HTML structure, you can do so through the ‘views’ folder. If you’re hoping to make appropriate changes to the styling of the website, you can do so through the ‘img’ and ‘style’ folders. If you’re hoping to make appropriate changes to the back-end development, please don’t. Contact Sage at sage.garrett@colorado.edu instead.

For the testing stage we used a manual testing system. Meaning that instead of building testing cases in Jasmine we manually tested our features by creating sample users, assignments (with due dates), and grades.

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION:
We do not have a current set up for continuous integration at the moment.
